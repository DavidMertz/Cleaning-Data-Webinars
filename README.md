# Cleaning-Data-Webinars

This repository contains material associated with the series
of webinars on cleaning data I deliver for Safari Online,
in association with my Addison Wesley book:

_Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science: Doing the Other 80% of the Work_

Excerpts from the book material will be utilized, as well
as both some of the same data sets and additional materials.
