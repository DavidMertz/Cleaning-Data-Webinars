# Cleaning-Data-Webinars

This repository contains material associated with the series
of webinars on cleaning data I deliver for Safari Online,
in association with my Addison Wesley book:

_Cleaning Data for Effective Data Science: Doing the Other 80% of the Work_

Excerpts from the book material will be utilized, as well
as both some of the same data sets and additional materials.

Please contact cleaning@kdm.training for more information on the 
book or suggestions about the webinar material.

Note: Some larger data sets that are associated with the book
and webinar may be kept at a separate repository.  This is a 
temporary organization, and will likely be updated later:
