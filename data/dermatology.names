   1. G. Demiroz, H. A. Govenir, and N. Ilter, 
      "Learning Differential Diagnosis of Eryhemato-Squamous Diseases using
       Voting Feature Intervals", Aritificial Intelligence in Medicine,

      The aim is to determine the type of Eryhemato-Squamous Disease.

4. Relevant Information:
     This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear
     valued and one of them is nominal. 

     The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real
     problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of
     erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in
     this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, 
     pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris.
     Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately
     these diseases share many histopathological features as
     well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a
     disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning
     stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. 
     Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features.
     Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22
     histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features
     are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. 

     In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature
     has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the
     family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of
     the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was
     given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the
     feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible,
     and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.

     The names and id numbers of the patients were recently 
     removed from the database.
