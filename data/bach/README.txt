Abstract: The data set is composed of 60 chorales (5665 events) by J.S. Bach
(1675-1750). Each event of each chorale is labelled using 1 among 101 chord
labels and described through 14 features.

 which is part of the Melisma music analyser (Melisma).  Chord labels have been
 manually annotated by a human expert.
